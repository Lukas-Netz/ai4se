## [A Systematic Literature Review of Explainable AI for Software Engineering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.06065)

> Context: In recent years, leveraging machine learning (ML) techniques has become one of the main solutions to tackle many software engineering (SE) tasks, in research studies (ML4SE). This has been achieved by utilizing state-of-the-art models that tend to be more complex and black-box, which is led to less explainable solutions that reduce trust and uptake of ML4SE solutions by professionals in the industry.
> Objective: One potential remedy is to offer explainable AI (XAI) methods to provide the missing explainability. In this paper, we aim to explore to what extent XAI has been studied in the SE community (XAI4SE) and provide a comprehensive view of the current state-of-the-art as well as challenge and roadmap for future work.
> Method: We conduct a systematic literature review on 24 (out of 869 primary studies that were selected by keyword search) most relevant published studies in XAI4SE. We have three research questions that were answered by meta-analysis of the collected data per paper.
> Results: Our study reveals that among the identified studies, software maintenance (\%68) and particularly defect prediction has the highest share on the SE stages and tasks being studied. Additionally, we found that XAI methods were mainly applied to classic ML models rather than more complex models. We also noticed a clear lack of standard evaluation metrics for XAI methods in the literature which has caused confusion among researchers and a lack of benchmarks for comparisons.
> Conclusions: XAI has been identified as a helpful tool by most studies, which we cover in the systematic review. However, XAI4SE is a relatively new domain with a lot of untouched potentials, including the SE tasks to help with, the ML4SE methods to explain, and the types of explanations to offer. This study encourages the researchers to work on the identified challenges and roadmap reported in the paper. 

## [AI in Software Engineering: A Survey on Project Management Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15224)

> Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the intelligence demonstrated by machines, and within the realm of AI, Machine Learning (ML) stands as a notable subset. ML employs algorithms that undergo training on data sets, enabling them to carry out specific tasks autonomously. Notably, AI holds immense potential in the field of software engineering, particularly in project management and planning. In this literature survey, we explore the use of AI in Software Engineering and summarize previous works in this area. We first review eleven different publications related to this subject, then compare the surveyed works. We then comment on the possible challenges present in the utilization of AI in software engineering and suggest possible further research avenues and the ways in which AI could evolve with software engineering in the future. 

## [Explainable AI for Software Engineering](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9678580)

> The success of software engineering projects largely depends on complex decision-making. For example, which tasks should a developer do first, who should perform this task, is the software of high quality, is a software system reliable and resilient enough to deploy, etc. However, erroneous decision-making for these complex questions is costly in terms of money and reputation. Thus, Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning (AI/ML) techniques have been widely used in software engineering for developing software analytics tools and techniques to improve decision-making, developer productivity, and software quality. However, the predictions of such AI/ML models for software engineering are still not practical (i.e., coarse-grained), not explainable, and not actionable. These concerns often hinder the adoption of AI/ML models in software engineering practices. In addition, many recent studies still focus on improving the accuracy, while a few of them focus on improving explainability. Are we moving in the right direction? How can we better improve the SE community (both research and education)?In this tutorial, we first provide a concise yet essential introduction to the most important aspects of Explainable AI and a hands-on tutorial of Explainable AI tools and techniques. Then, we introduce the fundamental knowledge of defect prediction (an example application of AI for Software Engineering). Finally, we demonstrate three successful case studies on how Explainable AI techniques can be used to address the aforementioned challenges by making the predictions of software defect prediction models more practical, explainable, and actionable.

## [Applications of AI in classical software engineering](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s42467-020-00005-4)

> Although Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become a buzzword for self-organizing IT applications, its relevance to software engineering has hardly been analyzed systematically. This study combines a systematic review of previous research in the field and five qualitative interviews with software developers who use or want to use AI tools in their daily work routines, to assess the status of development, future development potentials and equally the risks of AI application to software engineering. The study classifies the insights in the software development life cycle.
> The analysis results that major achievements and future potentials of AI are a) the automation of lengthy routine jobs in software development and testing using algorithms, e.g. for debugging and documentation, b) the structured analysis of big data pools to discover patterns and novel information clusters and c) the systematic evaluation of these data in neural networks. AI thus contributes to speed up development processes, realize development cost reductions and efficiency gains. AI to date depends on man-made structures and is mainly reproductive, but the automation of software engineering routines entails a major advantage: Human developers multiply their creative potential when using AI tools effectively.

## [Automated Unit Test Improvement using Large Language Models at Meta](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09171)

> This paper describes Meta's TestGen-LLM tool, which uses LLMs to automatically improve existing human-written tests. TestGen-LLM verifies that its generated test classes successfully clear a set of filters that assure measurable improvement over the original test suite, thereby eliminating problems due to LLM hallucination. We describe the deployment of TestGen-LLM at Meta test-a-thons for the Instagram and Facebook platforms. In an evaluation on Reels and Stories products for Instagram, 75% of TestGen-LLM's test cases built correctly, 57% passed reliably, and 25% increased coverage. During Meta's Instagram and Facebook test-a-thons, it improved 11.5% of all classes to which it was applied, with 73% of its recommendations being accepted for production deployment by Meta software engineers. We believe this is the first report on industrial scale deployment of LLM-generated code backed by such assurances of code improvement.
