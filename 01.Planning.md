### [Crowdsourcing Software Development: Task Assignment Using PDDL Artificial Intelligence Planning](https://s3.ap-northeast-2.amazonaws.com/journal-home/journal/jips/fullText/66/jips_531.pdf)

> The crowdsourcing software development (CSD) is growing rapidly in the open call format in a competitive environment. In CSD, tasks are posted on a web-based CSD platform for CSD workers to compete for the task and win rewards. Task searching and assigning are very important aspects of the CSD environment because tasks posted on different platforms are in hundreds. To search and evaluate a thousand submissions on the platform are very difficult and time-consuming process for both the developer and platform. However, there are many other problems that are affecting CSD quality and reliability of CSD workers to assign the task which include the required knowledge, large participation, time complexity and incentive motivations. In order to attract the right person for the right task, the execution of action plans will help the CSD platform as well the CSD worker for the best matching with their tasks. This study formalized the task assignment method by utilizing different situations in a CSD competition-based environment in artificial intelligence (AI) planning. The results from this study suggested that assigning the task has many challenges whenever there are undefined conditions, especially in a competitive environment. Our main focus is to evaluate the AI automated planning to provide the best possible solution to matching the CSD worker with their personality type.

### [Towards effective AI-powered agile project management](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8805739)

> The rise of Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to significantly transform the practice of project management. Project management has a large socio-technical element with many uncertainties arising from variability in human aspects, e.g. customers' needs, developers' performance and team dynamics. AI can assist project managers and team members by automating repetitive, high-volume tasks to enable project analytics for estimation and risk prediction, providing actionable recommendations, and even making decisions. AI is potentially a game changer for project management in helping to accelerate productivity and increase project success rates. In this paper, we propose a framework where AI technologies can be leveraged to offer support for managing agile projects, which have become increasingly popular in the industry.

### [Towards digitalization of requirements: generating context-sensitive user stories from diverse specifications](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10515-022-00324-2)

> Requirements Engineering in the industry is expertise-driven, heavily manual, and centered around various types of requirement specification documents being prepared and maintained. These specification documents are in diverse formats and vary depending on whether it is a business requirement document, functional specification, interface specification, client specification, and so on. These diverse specification documents embed crucial product knowledge such as functional decomposition of the domain into features, feature hierarchy, feature types and their specific feature characteristics, dependencies, business context, etc. Moreover, in a product development scenario, thousands of pages of requirement specification documentation is created over the years. Comprehending functionality and its associated context from large volumes of specification documents is a highly complex task. To address this problem, we propose to digitalize the requirement specification documents into processable models. This paper discusses the salient aspects involved in the digitalization of requirements knowledge from diverse requirement specification documents. It proposes an AI engine for the automatic transformation of diverse text-based requirement specifications into machine-processable models using NLP techniques and the generation of context-sensitive user stories. The paper describes the key requirement abstractions and concepts essential in an industrial scenario, the conceptual meta-model, and DizReq engine (AI engine for digitalizing requirements) implementation for automatically transforming diverse requirement specifications into user stories embedding the business context. The evaluation results from digitalizing specifications of an IT product suite are discussed: mean feature extraction efficiency is 40 features/file, mean user story extraction efficiency is 71 user stories/file, feature extraction accuracy is 94%, and requirement extraction accuracy is 98%.
